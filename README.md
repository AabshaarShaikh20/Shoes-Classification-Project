# Introduction 🚀
- Shoes Classification is a project designed to leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically classify different types of shoes. 
- This can be particularly useful in e-commerce applications, inventory management, and automated tagging of shoe images.

# Dataset 📦
The dataset consists of images of various shoe types like:

- Sandals
- Boots
- Slippers
The images are labeled and split into training and validation sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

# Model Architecture 🧠
The CNN model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and consists of the following layers:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max Pooling layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
The final layer uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each shoe category.

# Training 🎯
The model is trained using the following parameters:

- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: 5
- Learning rate: 0.001

# Evaluation 📊
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation is conducted on a separate validation set to ensure unbiased performance metrics.

# How To use🛠️
- Download the main "Project_CNN_ShoesClassification.ipyn" file and " Shoe Classification.zip" dataset file
- In main file, change the file path accordingly and you are good to go :)
